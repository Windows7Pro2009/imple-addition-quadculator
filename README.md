# How do I run the damn code?!

<b>Windows</b>

-Download the latest version of SAQ script file (ends in .py format) from the Releases page. <br />
-Open Command Prompt and type: <br />
```
python "C:\PathToTheScript\Simple.Addition.Quadculator.v0.2-alpha.py"
```
For example:
```
python "C:\Users\GeraldineDunn\Documents\Simple.Addition.Quadculator.v0.2-alpha.py"
```
OR

If you have set the CMD to the file directory where the script is in, then type:
```
python Simple.Addition.Quadculator.v0.2-alpha.py
```


<b>macOS/ Linux</b>

-Download the latest version of SAQ script file (ends in .py format) from the Releases page. <br />
-Open Terminal  <br />
-Then type ```python``` and drag the script file to the Terminal, which should look somethng like these examples given below: <br />

macOS<br/>
eg:
```
python /Users/Yogibabu/Downloads/Simple.Addition.Quadculator.v0.2-alpha.py
```

Linux<br/>
eg:
```
python 'home/Yogibabu/Downloads/Simple.Addition.Quadculator.v0.2-alpha.py'
```
-Then press the Return/ Enter key to run the script!

# But what's the *.exe version that you put out?

With the release of SAQ v0.2.1-alpha1, there's a .exe version for Windows. It's for those who either: <br/>
-don't know how to use Command Prompt :( <br/>
-Are too lazy to use Command Prompt {really dude? C'mon :( }

It's very simple, just open it like any executable file
(See the working of the exe file in "How it works" part)
